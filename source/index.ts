/**
 * An implementation of the Successive shortest path algorithm for solving a minimum cost flow problem
 * The implementation is nabbed from <https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/min_cost_flow.html>
 *
 * Assumptions:
 * - The nodes are sequentially numbered integers from 0 to (but not including) n.
 * - Node 0 is the source, node n-1 is the sink.
 * - Only one edge goes between any two nodes â€“ in either direction. In other words: no double edges in the same direction, and no back edges.
 *
 * @param {Array<Edge<number>>} graph The graph represented as an edge list
 * @param {number} desiredFlow The maximum flow you want; the algorithm stops when it reaches this number. Default is Infinity, indicating a desire for maximum flow.
 * @returns {Array<Required<Edge>>} The network updated to provide as much flow up to the limit specified by desiredFlow
